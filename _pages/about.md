I am a final year NERC DTP PhD student in the Institute of Geophysics
and Tectonics, University of Leeds, researching the origin of pallasite
meteorites and the nature of their parent body(/ies) using an
interdisciplinary approach involving multi-scale modelling of thermal
processes and analysis of meteorite samples. Pallasite meteorites
comprise a mixture of olivine and Fe-Ni metal (and various minor
phases), which have historically been explained as relict core-mantle boundary samples
from disrupted planetesimals. While this origin is under debate with
many alternative hypotheses suggested, these samples do still represent
a natural laboratory to study the behaviour of co-existing mantle-like
and core-like material. In order to better understand the environment
and context of formation of these meteorites, I have taken a multi-scale
approach: first, looking at the bigger picture and [modelling the
thermal evolution of the pallasite parent
body](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JE006726);
then, at the meso scale, investigating the processes in the region of
metal and olivine mixing; and finally, integrating micro-scale evidence
from samples (through SEM, EPMA and EBSD analysis) to model outputs to
constrain the parameter space and test different formation hypotheses.

I'm interested in open science, reproducible modelling and developing
open-source software. The source-code for our recently published study
[*The Conductive Cooling of Planetesimals With Temperature-Dependent
Properties*](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JE006726)
is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/murphyqm/pytesimal). We've
also further developed this code to make it more modular and useful and
have published it as a Python package, available on the [Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/pytesimal/) with [full documentation and
examples](https://pytesimal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) available to make
it easier to use.

I've worked extensively as a module assistant on a variety of courses,
including maths and geophysics tutorials, geology practical sessions,
and fieldwork, at both undergraduate and masters level. I also have
experience designing and facilitating a range of planetary science
themed outreach sessions, aimed at both the general public and specific
school groups, in person and online. I've developed downloadable
teaching materials for Space Hub Yorkshire (available
[here](https://spacehubyorkshire.org/skills-for-schools/) under
"Planetary Systems") and won an award for developing an [outreach
poster](https://www.panorama.researchposter.co.uk/2020/10/09/murphy-quinlan-maeve-peek-inside-a-planetesimal/)
as part of a NERC Panorama online conference. I've also written a [blog post](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2020/10/07/a-love-letter-to-science-fiction/) for the EGU Geodynamics blog.

I'm a member of a number of research groups within the [Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics): [Deep Earth](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/deep-earth), [Rocks, Melts, Fluids](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/rocks-melts-fluids-1), and last but not least, [Planetary Exploration](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-applied-geoscience/doc/planetary-exploration-1), which I help to organise. While the Covid-19 pandemic has changed how our research groups interact, we've continued to meet online to discuss new research, present novel papers, and deliver seminars on different topics in planetary science.
